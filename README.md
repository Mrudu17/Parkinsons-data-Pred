# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease Prediction
## 📚 Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual has Parkinson's disease based on a variety of biomedical voice measurements. Early diagnosis can be a game-changer, and this tool aims to assist in that mission.

🔬 **Why Parkinson's?**  
Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. There's no definitive test, but voice analysis has emerged as a promising method for early detection. This project explores that potential using machine learning.
